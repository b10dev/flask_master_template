# Nexus
Purpose:

    This is the master copy of all other flask applications and should not be altered.
    This app is written using the Flask Framework, Python as the server side language, HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap on the front end, and sqlite as the database.
    The general structure of this web application is modeled after the Flask "Blueprints".  This makes each section of the app
    modular.

    This will be updated as the project progresses.
